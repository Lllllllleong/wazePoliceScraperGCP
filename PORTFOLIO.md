- **Microservices Architecture**: The backend is composed of three distinct services (`scraper`, `alerts`, `archive`), each containerized with Docker and designed for independent deployment and scaling on Google Cloud Run. This demonstrates a grasp of modern, cloud-native design patterns.
- **CI/CD Automation**: The project includes GitHub Actions workflows for automated building, testing, and deployment of each microservice, showcasing proficiency in DevOps practices and modern software delivery pipelines.
- **Advanced Data Handling**: The system effectively manages the data lifecycle, using Firestore for real-time data and automatically archiving older data to Google Cloud Storage as JSONL files. This illustrates an understanding of cost-effective data management and performance optimization.
- **Concurrent and Performant Go**: The `alerts-service` leverages Go's concurrency features, using worker pools and streaming JSONL responses to efficiently handle large datasets and deliver a responsive experience.
- **Robust Data Modeling**: The `PoliceAlert` data model is designed to track the entire lifecycle of an alert, including its active duration, verification status, and community engagement metrics, enabling sophisticated data analysis.
- **Clean Code and Separation of Concerns**: The backend code is well-structured with a clear separation between the API layer, data storage logic, and external service clients (`waze`), making the codebase modular, maintainable, and easy to understand.
- **Idempotent Archive Service**: The `archive-service` includes an idempotency check to prevent duplicate archiving, a crucial feature for robust and reliable data processing pipelines.
